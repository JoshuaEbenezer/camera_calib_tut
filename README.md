Tutorials on 

* Camera calibration
* SIFT features
* Support Vector machines

I intend to add more tutorials to this repo as time permits. I write these primarily for myself because I find that the best way to learn is to compile material from diverse sources and present them in an easily understandable manner (similar to the thought behind Feynman's technique) but I hope you find these useful if you have stumbled upon these.
